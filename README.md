## Description
The idea of this project came along time ago and the reason was a collage of mine who dreamed to become a pizza master chef. He neglected all his job as a programmer and start to make a pizza. Nothing wrong with that Alex! That is why I decided to help him creating this project. The project represents a simple form to order food and drinks thru this app. Here I use a reactive forms to manage the user input. That is why the first thing after creation my app was to import { ReactiveFormsModule } in to "app.module.ts".
<br />

`import { ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';`

<br />
The project starts with a header and component which presents the header background image.

```
<div class="header">
    <app-images></app-images>
</div> 
```
Then I set food images on both sides of the body. For this puspose I created another two separate components in my component folder
```
<background_images_left>
<background_images_right>
```
On this project I used SCSS instead CSS. Next to it I created a form which hold the "food" and the "drinks" selectors.  and another form which contains the inputs for "name-address-phone". The "food" and "drinks" forms along with "address-name-phone" form have at the bottom json pipe.
```
{{ value_expression | json }}
```
Json pipe converts a value into its JSON-format. When the customer make his order, json changing it's value on the bootom of that page. In to the all of my components in theirs "ts" file I have used the "createFomr()" method, which contains the definition of my form fields. The exception is the "counter-input" component. My goal was to make my app more dynamic. That is why I imported "RouterModule" in to my app.module.ts file. 
```
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
```
Then I needed to add my navigation path and components to the imports array of @NgModule() section of app.module.ts file.
```
imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    RouterModule.forRoot([
      {path: 'home', component: HomeComponent},
      {path: 'about', component: AboutComponent},
      {path: 'contact', component: ContactComponent},
      {path: '', redirectTo: '/home', pathMatch: 'full'},
      {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
    ]),............
```
